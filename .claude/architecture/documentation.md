# Documentation — Where It Goes

All documentation lives in the user guide, **`grab-help-docs/content/docs`** — a
Next.js + Fumadocs app. Nothing else in this repo is documentation prose, with
the package `README.md`s and the agent skill as the two deliberate exceptions.

## `docs/` at the root is gone

It held three files and no documentation: a Jekyll `_config.yml`, an
`index.html` redirect to grab.js.org, and a `README.md` describing itself.

They were left over from when GitHub Pages deployed from a branch folder —
`/docs` being the only folder name Pages accepts besides the repository root.
**Pages no longer works that way.** Settings → Pages → Source is "GitHub
Actions", and `.github/workflows/pages.yml` publishes the static export built
from `grab-help-docs/out`. Nothing read `docs/` at all, so PR #47 deleted the
folder (commit `c894e60`).

Verify that claim rather than trusting this paragraph: the `Deploy docs to
Pages` workflow ends in `actions/deploy-pages@v5`, which **only succeeds when
Source is "GitHub Actions"**, and it is green on `master`.

So: put no documentation here, and do not recreate the folder.

## The Vercel deploy, and the root `vercel.json` that drives it

The `grab-url` Vercel project builds the docs app, not the library. Getting
there took two wrong Root Directory settings, and the history explains the
shape of the config that is there now.

**First it pointed at `docs/`.** While that folder existed turbo resolved no
package from it (`docs/` matched neither `packages/*` nor `grab-help-docs` in
the workspace globs), so it reported `No tasks were executed as part of this
run`, never wrote a `.next`, and Vercel failed with:

```
The file "/vercel/path0/docs/.next/routes-manifest.json" couldn't be found.
```

**Then #47 deleted the folder** and the build failed one step earlier, right
after the clone — same cause, louder error:

```
The specified Root Directory "docs" does not exist. Please update your Project Settings.
```

**Then the Root Directory was cleared to the repository root.** That gets past
the clone, but with no override Vercel runs the root `npm run build`, which is
`vite build` — it builds the library bundle and never touches Next.js:

```
The Next.js output directory ".next" was not found at "/vercel/path0/.next".
```

### What fixes it

`vercel.json` **at the repository root** — the file Vercel reads when the Root
Directory is the repo root — now supplies the three settings that were missing:

| Setting | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `installCommand` | `npm ci` | Same reason as the Pages workflow: the lockfile pins a compatible `fumadocs-openapi` / `fumadocs-ui` pair and a floating resolve does not. |
| `buildCommand` | `npx turbo run build --filter=grab-help-docs` | The root `build` script is `vite build`; only this reaches the Next.js app. |
| `outputDirectory` | `grab-help-docs/.next` | Where that build actually writes, relative to the repo root. |
| `build.env.VERCEL_PREVIEW_FEEDBACK_ENABLED` | `0` | Turns the preview toolbar's comments off. Next 16 uploads static files as immutable, which the comment injector cannot patch, so with it on every *preview* deployment dies after a successful build on `Cannot patch preview comments when immutable static file upload is enabled`. Production never patched them, so this changes nothing there. |

So the deploy is config-in-the-repo now, and no dashboard visit is needed as
long as **Root Directory stays empty (the repository root)**. Two settings
still have to stay as they are, and both are dashboard-only:

1. **Root Directory** — empty. Setting it back to a subdirectory makes Vercel
   read that subdirectory's `vercel.json` instead of this one.
2. **Install Command / Build Command / Output Directory overrides** — unset. A
   dashboard override beats `vercel.json`; the old `npm install --prefix=..`
   override in particular resolves above `/vercel/path0` from the repo root.

`grab-help-docs/vercel.json` is kept as the equivalent config for the other
arrangement — Root Directory `grab-help-docs`, paths relative to it. It is
inert while the Root Directory is the repo root. Whichever directory Vercel is
pointed at, one of the two files describes the build.

## Adding a page

1. Write `grab-help-docs/content/docs/<slug>.mdx` with frontmatter — `title` is
   required by `frontmatterSchema` in `source.config.ts`; `icon` takes a Lucide
   name.
2. Add the slug to `content/docs/meta.json`. Sections are `---Label---`
   separators; a subdirectory is included with `...<dir>` and needs its own
   `meta.json`.
3. MDX rules apply: a bare `{` or `<` outside a code fence is parsed as JSX —
   this is the specific reason Jekyll is kept away from the real docs.

## The generated skill page

`content/docs/claude-skill.mdx` is **generated**. The source of truth is
`skills/use-grab-request/SKILL.md`; `scripts/sync-skill-docs.mjs` regenerates the
page and writes the header telling you so.

```bash
npm run make:skill            # regenerate
node scripts/sync-skill-docs.mjs --check   # fail if stale, instead of writing
```

Edit the skill, regenerate, commit both. Editing the `.mdx` directly is undone by
the next `npm run make`.

## Two deployments, one source

| Target | Built by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **https://grab.js.org** (Vercel) | root `vercel.json` → `turbo run build --filter=grab-help-docs`, output `grab-help-docs/.next` | The full app — middleware, a Server Action and a POST route handler all work. Depends on the project's Root Directory staying empty; see the section above. |
| **GitHub Pages** | `.github/workflows/pages.yml` → `grab-help-docs/scripts/build-static-pages.mjs` → `actions/deploy-pages@v5` | A static export, served from `grab-help-docs/out`. `output: 'export'` supports none of those three server pieces, so the script **prunes them from the working tree** before building. It is destructive by design and refuses to run outside CI without `--force`. Green on `master`. |

The Pages workflow uses `npm ci`, not a floating install: `package-lock.json`
pins a compatible `fumadocs-openapi` / `fumadocs-ui` pair and a fresh resolve
picks versions that break the build.

## Package READMEs and the root README

Each `packages/*/README.md` documents that folder's own surface. The root
`README.md` is the npm landing page and the feature list — when you add a
user-visible capability, it belongs there, in the relevant docs page, and in the
skill if an agent would use it.
