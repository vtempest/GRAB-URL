# Architecture Overview

One npm package (`grab-url`) built from several source folders under
`packages/`, plus a documentation site and an agent skill. There is no
per-package build: the root `vite.config.ts` compiles every entry into one
`dist/`, and `package.json`'s `exports` map is the public surface.

## The packages

| Folder | Published as | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `grab-api` | the `grab-url` main entry | The `grab()` function. Zero runtime dependencies — that is the product claim. |
| `grab-url-cli` | `grab-url` / `grab` / `g` bins | The download CLI: HTTP, SFTP, torrents/magnets (aria2c), 700+ media sites (yt-dlp), page archiving. |
| `archiver-web` | `archiver-web`, `grab-url/…` bins | ZIP extract/create on JSZip. Frontend-only, no WASM. Powers auto-unzip. |
| `api2client` | `api2client` | Generates a typed client from an OpenAPI spec with Hey API, wired to send through `grab` instead of axios. |
| `log-json` | `grab-url/log` | `log()` — the colored JSON structure printer and request history. |
| `loading-animations` | `grab-url/animations` | Tree-shakable SVG spinners plus CLI terminal spinner frames. |
| `quantum-sphere-loading-animation` | `grab-url/icons/quantum-sphere` | The 3D orbital loader, React and Svelte. |
| `native-app-wrapper` | `native-app-wrapper` | Tauri scaffold packaging a site or a bundled CLI as a desktop/mobile app, driven by one JSON profile. Ships grab-url's downloader with yt-dlp as a sidecar. **Excluded from the workspace globs** (`"!packages/native-app-wrapper"`) — it installs and builds on its own. |

## Inside `grab-api`

```
src/index.ts              the grab() entry and the instance factory
src/index.slim.ts         the same, with the heavy processors externalized
src/core/
  core.ts                 the request lifecycle
  request-prep.ts         params, headers, baseURL, body encoding
  request-executor.ts     the fetch call (…-slim.ts is the trimmed variant)
  flow-control.ts         dedupe, cancel, rate limit, timeout, retry
  cache-pagination.ts     the frontend cache and infinite-scroll paging
  regrab-events.ts        refetch on refocus / network change / stale
  content-processors.ts   auto-JSON, auto-unzip, DOM parsing
src/response/
  response-handler.ts     shaping { data, error, isLoading } onto the response object
  infinite-scroll.ts      merging the next page, scroll position recovery
src/devtools/devtools.ts  the Ctrl+Alt+I overlay
src/common/{types,utils}.ts
```

A request runs: `request-prep` → `flow-control` (may short-circuit on dedupe,
rate limit or cache) → `request-executor` → `content-processors` →
`response-handler`. The response object is pre-initialized and mutated, which is
why `.isLoading` can be bound by any framework without a hook.

**Slim vs full.** `index.slim.ts` is a second entry that externalizes
`archiver-web` and `linkedom`, for consumers who do not want unzip and DOM
parsing pulled in. A change in `content-processors.ts` usually needs a matching
thought about whether the slim build still resolves.

## Inside `grab-url-cli`

```
src/index.ts              arg parsing → dispatch
src/cli-args.ts           the flag surface
src/transfer/
  media-domains.ts        which URLs get routed to yt-dlp (700+ domains)
  ytdlp-transfer.ts       yt-dlp, ytdlp-binary.ts installs/locates it
  aria2-transfer.ts       torrents and magnet links
  single-file-transfer.ts / multi-file-transfer.ts
  resume-state.ts         resumable transfers
src/page/                 --page: archive an article into ./<Page Title>/
src/background.ts         detach and keep going
src/keyboard-controls.ts  Ctrl+C offering resume/background rather than dying
src/display/, download-spinners.ts, cancel-state.ts
```

`--page` loads **`extract-webpage`** (the qwksearch extractor) through a runtime
`import()`. It is an optional peer dependency and must never enter the bundle —
it drags in jsdom/linkedom. `extract-webpage-loader.ts` exists to keep that
boundary; do not turn it into a static import.

yt-dlp is installed by `scripts/install-yt-dlp.mjs`, which runs on `postinstall`.
